    "Variational methods constitute a class of algorithms based on the **variational principle**, that allow to approximate the ground state of a physical system through a family of trial wavefunctions which have a fixed form and depend on a set of parameters. These methods are based on the reasearch of stationary points of a proper functional, that in the wavefunctions representation, is usually given by a multi-dimensional integral. The problem is that such integrals are usually extremely expensive to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are particularly helpful when studying the properties of many-body systems, where the interaction potential between particles may be treated with a **mean field** approximation or the trial wavefunction may be chosen as a product or a linear combination of one-particle wavefunctions.\\\n",
    "Examples of these procedures are given by the **Hartree-Fock** method used to determine the electronic ground state of a many-body system, or the **denisty matrix** approach in condensed matter physics, based on the **Kohn-Sham equations**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In computational physics, Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods evaluate numerically the multi dimensional integral, based on a Monte Carlo random number generation procedure. This approach has the relevant consequence that the functional can be evaluated with reduced computational costs, while the accuracy of the calculation, as in every other variational method implementation, is determined by the trial wavefunction choice.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to determine an approximation of the Helium ground state by implementing a minimization procedure for a two-bodies system based on a VMC method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the physical system and selected algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "VMC method is based upon the minimization of the energy functional of a quantum many body system, defined for a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ as the expectation value of the system Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$, normalized by the state squared norm : \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    E[\\psi] = \\frac{\\langle \\psi | \\hat{H} |\\psi \\rangle}{\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The variational principle ensures that this functional has a **minimum** when the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ lives in the eigenspace spanned by the system **ground state** $|\\phi_0\\rangle$, that is taken here to be non-degenrate. The ground state of the system can then be approximated by the implementation of a proper minimization procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Helium atom, if we neglect all interaction terms due to spin effects, the Hamiltonian is given in atomic units ($\\hbar = 1, a_0 = 1, 4\\pi\\epsilon_0 = 1, e=1$) by  \n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $r_{12} = |\\vec{r_1} - \\vec{r_2}|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider a family of trial wavefunctions $\\psi(\\boldsymbol{r};\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$ (here $\\boldsymbol{r}$ stands for both the electrons coordinates vectors $\\boldsymbol{r_1}$ and $\\boldsymbol{r_2}$) depending on a set of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$, then the energy functional con be written as a function of $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$. The minimization procedure is reduced in this case to search the set of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ that minimizes $E[\\psi;\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}]$.\n",
    "Rewritten in terms of wavefunctions the energy functional reads :\n",

    "Here the VMC method is used to determine numerically the last integral. Notice that in three dimensional (3D) space the local energy of a many body system of $N$ particle will depend on $3N$ cartesian coordinates, thus revealing the importance of a VMC implementation in order to reduce computational costs.\\\n",
    "For the Helium atom the ground state energy has been experimentally measured to be $E_0^{exp} = -2.904 eV$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Metropolis\n",
    "The mean value of $E_L$ is determined using **Monte Carlo Metropolis** algorithm. If the state of the system is described by a set of generalized coordinates $q$ (in this situation they are actually the two electrons cartesian coordinates) and the states are distributed with a weight function $W(q)$, Metropolis algorithm allows to sample the system states with the asymptotic distribution given by $W$. Thanks to this sampling, Metropolis algorithm allows to evaluate the mean value of irregular functions as well, as long as the weight function $W$ is a regular one.\\\n",
    "The idea is to generate a Markov chain of states  starting from an initial state of coordinates $\\boldsymbol{q_o}$. At each step one of the coordinates $q_i$ is randomly chosen and then randomly displaced. The displacement takes place in an interval $[-d,d]$ and can be performed by extracting a random number $\\epsilon$ in the interval $[0,1)$ and then displacing the i-th coordinate of a quantity $\\Delta q_i = d(2\\epsilon - 1)$, so that $\\boldsymbol{q_{new}} = (q_1, ..., q_i + \\Delta q_i, ... , q_N)$.\\\n",
    "Then the probability $P_{new} = W(\\boldsymbol{q_{new}})$ is used to evaluate the ratio $A = P_{new}/P_{old}$ that describes the probability that the new state generated by the Metropolis is more likely to be sampled than the previous one. Here another random number $\\zeta$ is randomly extracted in the interval $[0,1)$. If $A > \\zeta$ then the move is accepted and the displaced state is taken as a new state of the chain, otherwise it is rejected and the old state of the chain is repeated on the chain.\\\n",
    "If the algorithm starts in a state described by $\\boldsymbol{q_0}$ it may take a certain number of moves before the sampled states are distributed with $W$, so as a rule of thumb an **equilibration run** should always be considered to avoid sampling states with unbalanced distributions.\\\n",
    "In this algorithm we can also define the acceptance ratio as the ratio of accepted moves with respect to the total number of moves. Typycal values of the acceptance ratio are generally smaller than $0.5$ and may depend on the system or the chosen weight function.\\\n",
    "It should be stressed that, as the Metropolis algorithm works with ratios of the weight function evaluated on different states, it is unimportant to have a normalized weight function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Golden Section Search\n",
    "After the energy functional $E(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$ has been evaluated as the mean value of the local energy $E_L$ an optimization procedure must be implemented to find the value of $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ that minimizes the functional. This is due by using a **Golden Section Search** algorithm; this algorithm works with 1D scalar functions, so it will be necessary to write the energy functional as a scalar function $E_L(\\alpha)$ of just one variable.\\\n",
    "Once the minimum has been individuated to lie within a certain interval $(a,b)$ in parameter space, the scalar function is evaluated on the interval boundaries and on an inner point $c$ such that the ratio $d_{cb}/d_{ac}$ (here $d_{cb} = |c - b|$ is the distance between the two points on the interval) equals the golden ratio $\\varphi \\simeq 1.618...$\\\n",
    "Then another point $d$ between $c$ and $b$ (the largest subinterval) is chosen such to respect again the golden section rule in the interval $(c,b)$ and the scalar function $E(\\alpha)$ is evaluated on that point. If $E(d)$ is greater than $E(c)$ then the minimum is assumed to lie in the interval $(a,d)$, otherwise the minimum is assumed to lie in $(c,b)$. After this step, the iterative procedure repeats on the newly defined interval until the interval width falls under a certain tolerance.\\\n",
    "A variation of this algorithm is given by the **Brent** algorithm, where the convergence is speed up by the use of parabolic interpolation."

Thus is readily obtained by choosing $Z = 2$ so that the divergences introduced by the kinetic term cancels out the divergences introduced by the potential one. This way of canceling out divergences between terms of opposite sign is referred to as **cusp condition** imposition and will be extremely important in the following task to reduce the number of variational parameters."

    "Thanks to a Variational Monte Carlo algorithm the evaluation of the multidimensional integral defining the Helium Energy functional is accomplished with reduced computational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem encountered during the implementation of this algorithm is the effect of statistical noise that reduces the stability of the algorithm results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical experiments exposed show that this effect may be reduced by using the `split` method with a proper choice of the parameter $d$, determining the half width of the virtual displacements in `metropolis` function, and by choosing a greater number of steps for the `evaluate_energy` function.\\\n",
    "A bootstrap statistical analysis is also performed in order to try to reduce statistical uncertainty : on the one hand the bootstrap effectively introduces a smaller statistical error, on the other hand using the bootstrap procedure to resample a greatly fluctuating distribution may not be completely legitimate and could lead to underestimate the error, and thus to obtain numeric results incompatible with the analytic ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure more stable results with a not prohibitive time, an algorithm is proposed where the minimization procedure is repeated several times and a representative of the energy functional is chosen as the mean value of the obtained results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The obtained results show a good accordance with the analytic ones, even if the tatistical error falls on the first decimal digits, thus determining not too accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, in this project the VMC implementation shows all its flexibility, as it allows to evaluate the mean values of other relevant physical observables, such as the electronic distances from the nucleus and the interelectronic distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all these consideration made a last run of the script in the task B configuration is proposed, showing an effective improvement. \n",
    "The input parameters here are the same exposed in [Task B] section, with the esception of the parameter `steps = 100000` , `n_gs = n_ds = n_ev = 5` and `param_samples=11`. This run takes about $t \\simeq 7000 s$ for the direct search and the golden section search computation, and another $50 s$ for each `evaluate_energy` call.\\\n",
