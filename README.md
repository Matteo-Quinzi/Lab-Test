Each project has a corresponding directory, inside which a report file accompanies the developed code together with graphical tools:
* **Helium_GS** contains the project of the **helium ground state** evaluation through **Variational Monte Carlo** algorithm. The code is written in *python* and the report is given in a interactive *Jupyter Notebook*, making easier to understand the control flow of the program.
* **Morse eigen** is the folder of **Morse potential** project; the report file is a pdf file named `Morse`, located in the subdirectory `REPORT`, while the code, written in *fortran*, it is found in the other subdirectory `CODE`. 
* **Waves** contains the **wavepacket motion** project. As the former, in the two subdirectory `REPORT` and `CODE` are stored, respectively, the report file (`report.pdf`) and the code (written in *fortran*).
